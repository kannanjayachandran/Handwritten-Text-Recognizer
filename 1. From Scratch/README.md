# Neural Network

</div>

### This is a neural network implemented in python to recognize handwritten digits. The network is trained using the MNIST dataset available at kaggle. It is created using numpy and pandas. It is implemented from scratch without using any deep learning libraries. All the functions are implemented from scratch using numpy

## Architecture

- Input layer: 784 neurons (28x28 pixels) arranged in the for of a matrix.

- Hidden layer: 10 neurons

- Output layer: 10 neurons (0-9)

## This neural network uses

- Forward propagation

- BackPropagation

- Gradient descent

- One-hot-encoding

## Activation functions

- ReLU

- SoftMax

## Dependencies

- numpy
- pandas

## Usage

- Clone the repository
- Run the `main.ipynb` file

## Metrics

**This neural network contains only one hidden layer and there is no regularization. There are a variety of ways to improve the accuracy of the network.**

- Accuracy: 85% (Training) and 85% (Testing)
